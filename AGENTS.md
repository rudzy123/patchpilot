# PatchPilot agent and contributor guide

This is the central navigation document for coding agents and human contributors.

PatchPilot is a production-minded, self-hosted platform for software asset inventory, CycloneDX SBOM processing, vulnerability correlation, explainable environmental risk, remediation tracking, and audit-preserving evidence. The product must remain fully useful without an AI provider.

Read this file before editing. Then read the Cursor rules and documents that apply to the files you will change.

## Rule precedence

1. Repository-wide security, tenancy, and authorization rules in this file and in [`.cursor/rules/security.mdc`](.cursor/rules/security.mdc) always apply.
2. Instructions closer to a file (narrower Cursor rules, directory guides, or file-level comments) may **add** constraints.
3. Closer instructions **must not silently weaken** repository-wide security, tenancy, authorization, secret handling, or audit rules.
4. If two instructions conflict, keep the stricter security and tenancy interpretation and record the conflict in the change description or an ADR.

Do not treat product, styling, or convenience guidance as permission to bypass deny-by-default authorization, organization scoping, input validation, or secret handling.

## Current repository state

Application packages, manifests, and runtime code are not scaffolded yet. The layout below is the **target** modular monolith. Do not invent a different topology without an accepted ADR.

## Target repository layout

```text
apps/
  web/                         # Next.js App Router
  api/                         # Fastify TypeScript API
  worker/                      # Node.js TypeScript workers
packages/
  auth/
  config/                      # typed configuration; only place that may read process.env
  contracts/
  database/                    # Prisma and persistence adapters
  domain/
  integrations/
  logger/
  observability/
  policy-engine/
  sbom/
  test-utils/
  vulnerability-intelligence/
docs/
  adr/
  architecture/
  product/
  runbooks/
  security/
deploy/
  compose/
  containers/
examples/
  sample-sboms/
  vulnerable-apps/
```

Begin as a modular monolith with separately deployable `web`, `api`, and `worker` applications. Do not introduce microservices without a measured need and an accepted ADR.

## Cursor rules

| Rule | When it applies |
| --- | --- |
| [architecture.mdc](.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc) | Always: layering, dependencies, identifiers, time, transactions |
| [security.mdc](.cursor/rules/security.mdc) | Always: the ten security-sensitive areas (canonical) |
| [git-workflow.mdc](.cursor/rules/git-workflow.mdc) | Always: branches, commits, pull requests |
| [testing.mdc](.cursor/rules/testing.mdc) | Tests and fixtures |
| [database.mdc](.cursor/rules/database.mdc) | Prisma, migrations, persistence |
| [api.mdc](.cursor/rules/api.mdc) | Fastify API |
| [frontend.mdc](.cursor/rules/frontend.mdc) | Next.js web app |
| [workers.mdc](.cursor/rules/workers.mdc) | Workers, queue, outbox |
| [integrations.mdc](.cursor/rules/integrations.mdc) | External providers and feeds |
| [documentation.mdc](.cursor/rules/documentation.mdc) | Docs, ADRs, runbooks |

## Security-sensitive areas

Treat these as in-scope for threat modeling and review on every related change. Canonical rules: [architecture.mdc](.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc) and [security.mdc](.cursor/rules/security.mdc). Terms: [docs/product/glossary.md](docs/product/glossary.md).

1. Tenant isolation
2. SBOM handling
3. Vulnerability-intelligence provenance
4. External integrations
5. Background-job idempotency
6. Sensitive log redaction
7. Credential storage
8. Risk-score explainability
9. Audit integrity
10. Development versus production configurations

## Architectural invariants

Do not copy or weakly restate `security.mdc` here. If this file and a rule disagree, keep the stricter security and tenancy interpretation.

- Modular monolith only (`web`, `api`, `worker` share packages/schema). No microservices without an accepted ADR.
- Application **layer** (use cases) lives in `packages/`. Fastify handlers and Next.js are presentation. Next.js is not a second API.
- Deny by default. Tenant-owned data is scoped to the authorized organization, not a client-supplied id.
- Untrusted: SBOMs, archives, webhooks, feeds, headers, URLs, files, external API responses. Validate with Zod at boundaries.
- `process.env` only in `packages/config`. No hardcoded secrets. Canonical log redaction is in `security.mdc`.
- Outbox for durable work; at-least-once; idempotent handlers and relays, org-scoped for tenant work.
- Intelligence is versioned with provenance. Priorities are explainable and policy-versioned. AI must not set authoritative scores.
- Append-only audit for security- and remediation-sensitive operations. No cascade-delete of evidence.

AI features, if added later, are optional explanation and drafting aids. Users must supply their own API key or local compatible endpoint at runtime. API keys must never be hardcoded. The first usable release must work with AI disabled. GitHub and other source-control integrations are not MVP.

## Agent workflow

Before editing:

1. Read this file and applicable files under [`.cursor/rules/`](.cursor/rules/).
2. Inspect the existing repository. Do not assume applications already exist.
3. Summarize current state, assumptions, plan, security-sensitive changes, expected files, and ambiguities.
4. Stay inside the requested scope.

During implementation:

1. Work in small coherent batches. Do not rewrite unrelated files.
2. Add or update tests with implementation.
3. Create new database migrations rather than editing applied migrations.
4. Do not add dependencies without explaining why they are required.
5. Prefer established standards and libraries over custom security mechanisms.
6. Run appropriate checks after each coherent batch.
7. Do not scaffold applications or product functionality unless the task explicitly asks for them.

After implementation:

1. List created and modified files.
2. Explain important decisions.
3. Report executed commands and their actual results. Do not claim that commands passed unless they were executed.
4. Identify untested areas, remaining risks, and follow-up work.
5. Suggest one focused Conventional Commit message.
6. Do not describe work as production-ready merely because tests pass.

## Git and reviews

Use short-lived feature branches and [Conventional Commits](docs/development/commit-guidelines.md). Open a pull request. Do not push directly to `main`. Required checks and review expectations are defined in [docs/development/branching-strategy.md](docs/development/branching-strategy.md) and [docs/development/review-checklist.md](docs/development/review-checklist.md).

Do not file security vulnerabilities as public issues. Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
